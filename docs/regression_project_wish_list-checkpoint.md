## 1. Daily task wishlist to be completed by the end of tomorrow (10/30/2018)
###  1.1  config_param 
-- some more variables could be descrbed as param
###  1.2  data_prep    
-- The parquet file reading part need to be improved to make it complete.
###  1.3  data_summary 
-- 
###  1.4  directoryPath 
--
###  1.5  DLModels      
-- more models need to be included; maybe separating modeling some utilities such as plot
###  1.6  evaluatin_metric 
--
###  1.7  H2OModels        
-- completing it
###  1.8  lime_ModelExplainer  
-- deciding optimal number of features to be explained. At the momemt it is only ten.
###  1.9  log_outputs

## 2. Resource wishlist
###   2.1. GPU capabilities on the server could be beneficial as that helps in optimizing some of the algorithms such as neural net much better. 
###   2.2. What-if-tool -- dashboard kind of 
###   2.3.
